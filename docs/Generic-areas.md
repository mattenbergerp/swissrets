# Generic Areas

All `<characteristics>` that start with  `<area***>` but not `<areaSia***>` are listed here to clarify what areas can be specified outside of the SIA standard. These areas are of a more novice nature and are designed to give meaning to areas for end-customers. These are not necessarily objective and can be subjective in nature. They are more informative than fact, so that future buyers and renters can more easily visualize what areas are involved within the offer.
